# Euclideanâ€™s theorem.
# Gcd is the greatest number which is divided by
# both a and b.If a number is divided by both a and b,
# it is should be divided by (a-b) and b as well.

# GCD(a,b) = GCD(b,a%b)
def gcd(a,b):

    for i in range(1,min(a,b)+1):
        if a%i==0 and b%i==0:
            gcd=i
